  name        : "Andrew Severin"
  bio         : "His PhD was in Biophysics/NMR spectroscopy.  He did a Bioinformatics Postdoc in Soybean genetics and now runs the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University.  He is passionate about evolution and the science behind the genome. There is so much we don't know about how the elements in a genome interact to create the fine balance of gene expression, modification and 3D structure that create the dynamic range of phenotypes we observe.  As sequencing technology continues to improve and the cost continues to decrease, we will be able to ask more complex questions that increase our understanding via comparative and translational genomics.

Aleksandra Badaczewska:
  name        : "Aleksandra Badaczewska"
  bio         : "My Ph.D. was in Computational Biology, and I specialized in Structural Bioinformatics tasks. My great passion is graphic design and software development. That includes the programmatic creation of interactive and portable graphs. My mission as a Research Scientist at the Genome Informatics Facility is to develop a comprehensive collection of highly customizable visualization solutions for bioinformatics and geospatial analyses. In tandem with this, I am looking into incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies for improving bioinformatics challenges. I may provide broad support in optimization and robustness of software written in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  "
