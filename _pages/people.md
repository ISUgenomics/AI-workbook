My Ph.D. was in Computational Biology, and I specialized in Structural Bioinformatics tasks. My great passion is graphic design and software development. That includes the programmatic creation of interactive and portable graphs. My mission as a Research Scientist at the Genome Informatics Facility is to develop a comprehensive collection of highly customizable visualization solutions for bioinformatics and geospatial analyses. In tandem with this, I am looking into incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies for improving bioinformatics challenges. I may provide broad support in optimization and robustness of software written in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
